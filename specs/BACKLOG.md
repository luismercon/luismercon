# Backlog

Tracks implementation status of each spec in [SPECS.md](SPECS.md). SPECS.md is the source of truth for
*what* each spec requires — this file only tracks *whether it's done*. Check a box when the spec is fully
implemented and verified against its Given/When/Then criteria. Don't edit SPECS.md to reflect status.

## 1. Project init, structure, config
- [x] [SPEC-001 — Hugo Project Initialization](SPECS.md#spec-001) — `hugo.yaml` builds clean with `hugo --minify`
- [ ] [SPEC-002 — Directory Structure](SPECS.md#spec-002) — `content/`, `layouts/`, `assets/css/`, `archetypes/`, `i18n/` now exist; favicon/og-default images are generated via Hugo Pipes from `assets/images/favicon.png` (no `static/images/`, no `logo.svg`/`favicon.ico` — see CLAUDE.md/head.html) ; `.github/workflows/` still missing (group 17)
- [x] [SPEC-003 — Permalink Configuration](SPECS.md#spec-003) — `hugo.yaml` has the blog permalink and a 2-item main menu (Blog, About). SPECS.md describes a 4-item menu incl. Social Media and Topics; both were built and then deliberately removed by the user (see groups 12/16) — SPECS.md is left as-is per project convention, treat this entry as the current authority on the menu, not SPEC-003's text

## 2. Design tokens, dark mode, fonts
- [x] [SPEC-012 — CSS Design Tokens](SPECS.md#spec-012) — `assets/css/tokens.css` ported from the Claude Design bundle ("Luis Brand"); `assets/css/main.css` also written (Direction A "Essay" baked in)
- [x] [SPEC-013 — Theme Toggle (Dark/Light)](SPECS.md#spec-013) — toggle button in header + inline script in `head.html`/`baseof.html`; verified default dark, no FOUC on stored "light" preference
- [x] [SPEC-014 — Font Loading](SPECS.md#spec-014) — Google Fonts `<link>` tags (preconnect + CSS2 `display=swap`) wired into `layouts/partials/head.html`; verified in rendered output

## 3. Base layout
- [x] [SPEC-015 — Base Layout](SPECS.md#spec-015) — `layouts/_default/baseof.html` + partials; `hugo --minify` builds clean, dev server verified via curl

## 4. SEO (head.html)
- [x] [SPEC-025 — Canonical URLs](SPECS.md#spec-025) — `<link rel="canonical">` in `layouts/partials/head.html`, falls back to `.Permalink` when `canonicalURL` is unset
- [x] [SPEC-026 — Meta Tags and Open Graph](SPECS.md#spec-026) — OG + Twitter Card tags in `head.html`; `og:image` falls back to a Hugo Pipes-generated 1200x630 crop of `assets/images/favicon.png` when no page `images` are set
- [x] [SPEC-027 — Hreflang Tags](SPECS.md#spec-027) — loops `.AllTranslations` (self-referencing tag included); verified pt-br/en pair on the sample post
- [x] [SPEC-028 — Structured Data (JSON-LD)](SPECS.md#spec-028) — `BlogPosting` block only on single blog posts, built via `dict`/`jsonify`/`safeJS` (plain string interpolation inside `<script>` double-escapes under Hugo's contextual auto-escaping — verified and fixed)

## 5. RSS
- [x] [SPEC-029 — RSS Feed](SPECS.md#spec-029) — custom `layouts/_default/rss.xml` adds `content:encoded` (full post HTML in CDATA) alongside the existing summary `description`, serves both `/index.xml` (site-level, via `site.RegularPages`) and `/blog/index.xml` (section-level); RSS autodiscovery `<link>` added to `head.html`; all three feeds (pt-br, en, home) verified well-formed XML. Note: literal `<?xml ?>` and `<![CDATA[`/`]]>` text needed `| safeHTML` — Hugo's html/template auto-escaper HTML-entity-encodes any `<` not followed by a recognized tag-start character

## 6. Analytics
- [x] [SPEC-030 — Umami Analytics Script](SPECS.md#spec-030) — `layouts/partials/analytics.html`, included from `head.html`; renders only when `params.umami.websiteId`/`src` are set in `hugo.yaml`; verified both that the tag renders with real values and that it's absent when the params are removed
- [x] [SPEC-031 — Analytics Event Tracking](SPECS.md#spec-031) — `data-umami-event` on footer LinkedIn/RSS links and the About page LinkedIn link now actually fires events with SPEC-030 wired up. The "links to original social media posts" requirement in SPEC-031's text no longer applies — Social Media was removed (see group 12); nothing to track there

## 7. Header, mobile menu, language switcher
- [x] [SPEC-016 — Header (Desktop)](SPECS.md#spec-016) — `layouts/partials/header.html`
- [x] [SPEC-017 — Header (Mobile)](SPECS.md#spec-017) — hamburger + drawer, toggled by inline script in `baseof.html`
- [x] [SPEC-007 — Language Switcher](SPECS.md#spec-007) — `layouts/partials/language-switcher.html`; verified `/en/...` translation link renders

## 8. Footer
- [x] [SPEC-018 — Footer](SPECS.md#spec-018) — `layouts/partials/footer.html`; LinkedIn (from `data/social.yaml`) + RSS link with icon, copyright line

## 9. i18n wiring
- [x] [SPEC-004 — Filename-Based i18n Strategy](SPECS.md#spec-004) — verified `/en/blog/on-refactoring-systems-you-inherit/` resolves as the translation
- [x] [SPEC-005 — Translated Slugs for SEO](SPECS.md#spec-005) — English post overrides `slug`, pt-br keeps filename-derived slug
- [x] [SPEC-006 — UI String Translations](SPECS.md#spec-006) — `i18n/pt-BR.yaml` + `i18n/en.yaml`

## 10. Content models and archetypes
- [x] [SPEC-008 — Blog Post Content Model (pt-BR)](SPECS.md#spec-008) — real post matches the contract
- [x] [SPEC-009 — Blog Post Content Model (English)](SPECS.md#spec-009) — real `.en.md` translation with `slug` override
- [ ] ~~SPEC-010 — Social Media Embed Content Model~~ — **dropped**: the Social Media feature was tried (first per-post content files, then a data-driven single page) and then removed entirely by user decision (see group 12); no content model exists or is planned
- [x] [SPEC-011 — Content Archetypes](SPECS.md#spec-011) — `archetypes/blog.md` only; `archetypes/socialmedia.md` was deleted along with the rest of the Social Media feature (group 12)

## 11. Blog templates
- [x] [SPEC-020 — Blog Listing Page](SPECS.md#spec-020) — `layouts/blog/list.html`, reuses `partials/post-list.html`
- [x] [SPEC-021 — Blog Post Page](SPECS.md#spec-021) — `layouts/blog/single.html`; TOC via `.Fragments.Headings` (new scope from the handoff, see CLAUDE.md)

## 12. Social media templates
- [ ] ~~SPEC-022 — Social Media Listing Page~~ — **dropped**: built as a grouped-by-platform listing, then rebuilt as a single data-driven embed page, then abandoned entirely by user decision. No `/socialmedia/` route, templates, or content exist
- [ ] ~~SPEC-023 — Social Media Embed Page~~ — **dropped**, same decision as SPEC-022 above; never had per-post permalink pages in the final (also abandoned) design, and now nothing under `/socialmedia/` exists at all

## 13. About page
- [x] [SPEC-024 — About Page](SPECS.md#spec-024) — `layouts/about/list.html` (monogram, facts list); content in `content/about/_index.md` + `_index.en.md`

## 14. Homepage
- [x] [SPEC-019 — Homepage](SPECS.md#spec-019) — `layouts/index.html`, pulls posts via `site.GetPage "/blog"`

## 15. Responsive breakpoints
- [x] [SPEC-032 — Responsive Layout: Mobile](SPECS.md#spec-032) — verified visually via Playwright screenshots at 375px: hamburger menu, single-column layout, footer columns stack vertically (`.site-footer__top` wraps), TOC renders as a boxed callout. `main.css` uses fluid `clamp()` tokens instead of the original fixed `--space-4`/`--text-base` (per SPEC-012's note, this supersedes the old token names) — `--gutter` computes to 1.25rem (20px, clamp floor) and `--fs-body` to ~1.06rem at this width. "Social media iframes scale to full container width" no longer applies — Social Media was removed (group 12)
- [x] [SPEC-033 — Responsive Layout: Tablet](SPECS.md#spec-033) — verified at 800px: horizontal nav (≥768px breakpoint in `main.css:183`), single-column layout, `--gutter` computes to 2.5rem (40px)
- [x] [SPEC-034 — Responsive Layout: Desktop](SPECS.md#spec-034) — verified at 1280px: page content centered via `.wrap`/`.prose-wrap` (`max-width: var(--maxw-wide)`/`var(--maxw-prose)`), blog post body constrained to `--maxw-prose` (42rem, ~66ch) for comfortable reading width, TOC switches from boxed callout to sticky rail exactly at the 960px breakpoint (`main.css:289`, confirmed with screenshots at 959px vs 960px)

**Note:** SPEC-021's text says the desktop TOC sits "to the left of the article," but `main.css:293`'s grid
(`grid-template-columns: minmax(0, var(--maxw-prose)) 14rem`) places `.article-main` in column 1 and
`.article-aside` in column 2 — the TOC renders to the *right* of the article body. User confirmed this is
the intended layout (matches the Claude Design handoff bundle) — SPECS.md's "left" wording is simply
outdated and is left as-is per project convention (BACKLOG.md is the status/deviation record, not SPECS.md).

## 16. Topics (tags) taxonomy
- [ ] ~~SPEC-040 — Topics (Tags) Taxonomy Pages~~ — **dropped**: built and verified working, then removed by user decision — the user doesn't plan to use tags on blog posts. No `/tags/` route, templates, content, or `tags:` frontmatter field exist

## 17. Deployment
- [ ] [SPEC-035 — GitHub Actions Deployment](SPECS.md#spec-035)

## 18. Sample content
- [x] One bilingual blog post (pt-BR + en, see SPEC-008/SPEC-009) — "Sobre Refatorar Sistemas que Herdamos" / "On Refactoring Systems You Inherit"
- [ ] ~~One social media embed~~ — n/a, Social Media was dropped (see group 12)

## 19. Final validation
- [ ] Lighthouse audit
- [ ] Open Graph debugger
- [ ] RSS validator

## Reference & process specs
Not part of the numbered build sequence — describe ongoing author workflows and project docs rather than a
one-time build artifact. Check off once the workflow has been exercised at least once / the doc exists.
- [x] [SPEC-039 — CLAUDE.md Project File](SPECS.md#spec-039) — done, `CLAUDE.md` exists at repo root
- [ ] [SPEC-036 — Blog Post Publication Workflow](SPECS.md#spec-036)
- [ ] ~~SPEC-037 — Social Media Publication Workflow~~ — **dropped**, Social Media was removed entirely (see group 12); no publication workflow exists or is needed
- [x] [SPEC-038 — Claude Design Handoff Workflow](SPECS.md#spec-038) — exercised end-to-end: imported project "Luis Brand" via the Claude Design connector, tokens translated into `assets/css/`, templates built following the bundle
